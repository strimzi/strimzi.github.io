I have:

* [ ] Checked that the problem is not about the Strimzi documentation.
  Documentation issues (those with URLs starting https://strimzi.io/docs/...) should be reported [here](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/new?title=Docs:&labels=documentation).
* [ ] Included the URL of the page my issue is about
* [ ] Described what I did see and what I was expecting to see
