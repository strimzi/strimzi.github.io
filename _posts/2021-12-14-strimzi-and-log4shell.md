The [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability in the [Log4j2 logging library](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) - also known as Log4Shell - affects many software projects written in Java.
Several Strimzi components and dependencies use Log4j2.
Much has been written about how the vulnerability works and how it can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized control over your system.
We will not get into the finer details here.
In short, if an attacker can get your application to log an arbitrary log message (or part of it), it can be used to execute arbitrary code, loaded from an attacker-controlled remote server, inside your application.
In this blog post, we will have a look at which parts of your Strimzi deployment might be affected and how the vulnerability can be mitigated.

## Is Strimzi affected?

When using Strimzi, you first deploy the Cluster Operator as the central component.
Then you use it to deploy the operands.
Finally, each operand might consist of multiple different components.
For example, when you deploy the Kafka cluster using the `Kafka` custom resource, it does not deploy just the Kafka brokers.
It also deploys the ZooKeeper cluster, the topic and user operators, and possibly Cruise Control and Kafka Exporter.
There are also some components which are deployed separately, such as the Drain Cleaner.

All the available components are listed here:
* Cluster Operator
* Topic Operator
* User Operator
* Strimzi Kafka Bridge
* Strimzi Drain Cleaner
* Strimzi Canary
* Kafka brokers
* ZooKeeper nodes
* Kafka Connect
* Kafka Mirror Maker 1
* Kafka Mirror Maker 2
* Cruise Control
* Kafka Exporter
* TLS sidecars
* Kaniko container builder

Let's have a look at these components and identify those which are and are not affected by the Log4j2 vulnerability.

### Unaffected components

Several of the components are not affected because they do not use Java at all.
This includes the [Kafka Exporter](https://github.com/danielqsj/kafka_exporter) and [Strimzi Canary](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-canary) which are written in Golang.
The [Kaniko builder](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko) used to build the Kafka Connect images is also written in Golang
The TLS sidecars used in Cruise Control and the Entity Operator are based on [Stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/), which is written in C.

The last unaffected component is the [Strimzi Drain Cleaner](https://github.com/strimzi/drain-cleaner).
The Drain Cleaner is written in Java, but it only uses the Log4j2 library in tests, not when it's used by users.
The next release of Drain Cleaner will contain the Log4j2 fix (for these tests) as well.
But until then, you can continue to use Drain Cleaner in your environment.

### Affected components

This leaves us with five affected components.
All [Strimzi operators](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator) up to and including version 0.26.0 use Log4j2.
As does the [Strimzi Kafka Bridge](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-bridge) up to and including version 0.20.3.
The [Cruise Control](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control) version used by Strimzi operators from 0.22.0 up until 0.26.0 are affected as well.

The operators and Cruise Control are normally accessible only internally within your Kubernetes cluster.
We are currently not aware of any way of exploiting the vulnerability, either through Apache Kafka or directly.
But we cannot exclude such a possibility.

The Strimzi Kafka Bridge is used to access the Kafka cluster using HTTP or AMQP protocols.
As such, it is often exposed to more open networks and environments which makes it vulnerable.

### What about Kafka?

[Apache Kafka project](https://kafka.apache.org/) is currently using the [Log4j 1.x library](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/).
This is a predecessor of Log4j2 and is not affected by CVE-2021-44228.
This applies to the Kafka brokers, as well as ZooKeeper, Kafka Connect, and MirrorMaker 1 & 2.

While in this case using Log4j 1 proved useful, its usage has its own problems.
Log4j 1 is no longer maintained and has its own CVEs, though they are not as critical as CVE-2021-44228.
The Apache Kafka project is working on replacing Log4j 1 with Log4j2 in the future.

The Log4j 1 CVE [CVE-2021-4104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104) is very similar to the Log4Shell CVE.
But there is one main difference -- it affects Log4j 1 only when you use the `JMSAppender` with specific configuration.
The `JMSAppender` is not used by default.
If you make sure that you do not use the `JMSAppender` in your Kafka or ZooKeeper logging configuration, you should not be affected by it.

## Mitigating the Log4j2 vulnerability

There are two ways you can mitigate the Log4j2 vulnerability with Strimzi.
The Log4j2 project released version 2.15.0 of their library, which fixes the CVE.
Using this new version of Log4j2 in your environments is the best way to address the vulnerability.
An alternative way is to disable the remote lookups in the older versions of the Log4j2 library.

### Upgrading Strimzi to fix the Log4j2 vulnerability

After finding out about the CVE, we worked on a fix for this vulnerability in our projects by including a new -- fixed -- version of Log4j.
We have released version [0.21.0](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-bridge/releases/tag/0.21.0) of the Strimzi Kafka Bridge, which uses the new version of the library and should be safe to use.
We have also released version [0.26.1](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/releases/tag/0.26.1) of our operators, which includes the new version of the Kafka Bridge.
Log4j2 2.15.0 is used in all Strimzi operators.
Log4j2 is updated in the Cruise Control deployment as well.

**We recommend you upgrade to these new versions of Strimzi as soon as possible.**

Of course, the fixes will also be in the upcoming 0.27.0 release.

### Alternative to upgrading Strimzi

If, for some reason, you cannot upgrade to Strimzi Kafka Operators 0.26.1 and Strimzi Kafka Bridge 0.21.0, you can try to mitigate the issue by disabling the JNDI lookups.
You can do that by setting the Java system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true`.
Different Strimzi components have different ways to set this option.

#### Cluster Operator

For the Cluster Operator, you can edit the Kubernetes deployment and add a new environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` with value `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`.
Once you apply these changes, Kubernetes will roll the operator pod and use this option.
The following example snippet shows how the Deployment with the new environment variable:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: strimzi-cluster-operator
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      # ...
      containers:
        - name: strimzi-cluster-operator
          # ...
          env:
            # ...
            - name: JAVA_OPTS
              value: "-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"
            # ...
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
```

If you installed Strimzi using OperatorHub, you cannot just edit the operator deployment because any changes you make will be reverted by the OperatorHub.
But you can [set custom environment variables in the `Subscription` resource](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/subscription-config.md#env).

The Strimzi 0.26 Helm Chart doesn't have an option to configure custom environment variables.
But in many cases, you should be able to add the environment variable to the deployment after it was created by the Helm Chart.
You can also edit the Deployment template inside the Helm Chart to add the environment variable to it before deploying the Helm Chart.

#### Topic and User Operators

For Topic and User operators, you can set the system property using the `Kafka` custom resource and its `jvmOptions`.
The Topic and User operator run in the same pod, but they each have their own container.
So remember that you have to set it for both of them:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  labels:
    app: my-cluster
spec:
  # ...
  entityOperator:
    userOperator:
      # ...
      jvmOptions:
        javaSystemProperties:
          - name: log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups
            value: "true"
    topicOperator:
      # ...
      jvmOptions:
        javaSystemProperties:
          - name: log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups
            value: "true"
  # ...
```

#### Cruise Control

For Cruise Control, you can pass the system property through the `Kafka` custom resource as well.
But this time, using the `template` section where we add the system property into the `KAFKA_OPTS` environment variable:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  labels:
    app: my-cluster
spec:
  # ...
  cruiseControl:
    # ...
    template:
      cruiseControlContainer:
        env:
          - name: KAFKA_OPTS
            value: -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
  # ...
```

If you did not enable Cruise Control in your Kafka cluster, you can of course just skip this step.

#### Strimzi Kafka Bridge

For Strimzi Kafka Bridge, the system property can be passed as an environment variable as well.
But for the Kafka Bridge, we have to use `JAVA_OPTS`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: KafkaBridge
metadata:
  name: my-bridge
spec:
  replicas: 1
  bootstrapServers: my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092
  http:
    port: 8080
  template:
    bridgeContainer:
      env:
        - name: JAVA_OPTS
          value: -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
```

#### Verification

After you apply all the changes, you might want to verify that they are really being used.
One of the ways you can do it is to open a terminal inside the running pod and check the running processes.
In most of the containers, you should see a process like this:

```
exec /usr/bin/tini -w -e 143 -- java ...
```

And somewhere there, after the `java` keyword, you should see the options passed to the Java application.
If you do not see the system property, you should probably double check the configuration to make sure that you didn't make any typos and that the YAML is correctly aligned.

## Conclusion

Bugs and CVEs are an inseparable part of any software project.
We all hope that another CVE which is as critical and as widespread as this doesn't show up for a long time.
But there will always be new bugs and CVEs.
