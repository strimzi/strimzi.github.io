When you want to start developing applications using Apache Kafka, you can just go to http://kafka.apache.org, download the latest binary, unpack it, and use it. 
But sometimes you need something more. 
For example a Kafka cluster with multiple nodes to be able to use replication or test fail-overs. 
Or you might need to change the configuration - maybe to enable encryption or authentication. 
And that is not so easy anymore. 
Using Strimzi with Minikube can make things much easier. 
You can deploy multi-node cluster with enabled security very easily with just few lines of YAML. 
Watch our video to get started.
