Following the success of [StrimziCon 2024](https://strimzi.io/blog/2024/06/06/strimzicon2024-roundup/) and [StrimziCon 2025](https://strimzi.io/blog/2025/06/16/strimzicon2025-roundup/), we're pleased to announce the third edition, scheduled for later this year!
As in previous years, the event is going to be focused on our beloved Strimzi and Apache Kafka projects and will be held _virtually_.
The event is organized by the Strimzi maintainers in collaboration with the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).

### Why attend StrimziCon?

StrimziCon is a community event for developers, DevOps engineers, and solution architects who want to learn about Strimzi and event streaming.
This event will bring together the Strimzi community to share real‑world use cases, best practices, and first‑hand experience from experts and users alike.
If you work with cloud-native technologies, and need to manage data in motion in a cloud-based environment, this event is for you.

The conference will take place on <b>Wednesday, June 3rd, 2026</b> (afternoon CEST).

The call for <b>speakers</b> is now open, and we're eagerly awaiting your proposals to discuss:

* <b>Core Strimzi</b>: Deep dive into a specific component or feature.
* <b>Case Studies</b>: Provide an overview of a use case or review of a real-world Strimzi deployment, highlighting difficulties, lessons learned, and key takeaways.
* <b>Integrations</b>: Explore how Strimzi integrates with other open source or CNCF projects.
* <b>Operations</b>: Share insights into what it takes to run Strimzi and maintain clusters in production.

The submission deadline is March 31st, 2026.

### From the community to the community

We encourage any community members to submit a talk: from a Strimzi deep dive, to how you operate and use it in production, through integrations with other projects.
From the community to the community, this is the best way to share.
