Following the success of [StrimziCon 2024](https://strimzi.io/blog/2024/06/06/strimzicon2024-roundup/) and [StrimziCon 2025](https://strimzi.io/blog/2025/06/16/strimzicon2025-roundup/), we're excited to announce the third edition scheduled later this year!
Like last year, this is going to be focused on our beloved Strimzi and Apache Kafka projects and it will be "virtual".
It is organized and driven by the project maintainers in collaboration with the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

### Why attend StrimziCon?

StrimziCon is an event for developers, DevOps engineers, and solution architects who want to learn about Strimzi and event streaming.
This event will bring together the Strimzi community, and you will learn from experts and users about use cases, best practices, and their experience using Strimzi in their organizations.
If you are working with cloud-native technologies, and you are looking for how to deal with data in motion in a cloud-based environment, don’t miss the opportunity.

The conference will take place on <b>Wednesday, June 3rd</b> (afternoon CEST).

The call for <b>speakers</b> is now open, and we're eagerly awaiting your proposals to discuss:

* <b>Core Strimzi</b>: Deep dive into a specific component or feature.
* <b>Case Studies</b>: Provide an overview of a use case or review of a real life Strimzi deployment, highlighting difficulties, lessons learned, and key takeaways.
* <b>Integrations</b>: Explore how Strimzi integrates with other open source or CNCF projects.
* <b>Operations</b>: Share insights into what it takes to run Strimzi and maintain clusters in production.

The submission deadline is March 31st.

### From the community to the community

We encourage any community members to submit a talk: from a Strimzi deep dive, to how you operate and use it in production, through integrations with other projects.
From the community to the community, this is the best way to share.

Paolo Patierno and Kate Stanley, as maintainers and contributors in the Strimzi community, have been organizing the conference together with the CNCF team, and will be your host during the event.
