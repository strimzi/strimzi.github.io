The Strimzi 0.29.0 release introduces the new `UseKRaft` feature gate.
This feature gate provides a way to deploy a Kafka cluster in the KRaft (Kafka Raft metadata) mode without ZooKeeper.
This feature gate is currently in an experimental stage, but it can be used for development and testing of Strimzi and Apache Kafka.
It is not production ready, but if you are interested feel free to give it a try.
You can learn more about this new feature, how to use it, and what to be cautious about in our new video.
