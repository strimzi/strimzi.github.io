Logging is an indisputably important feature for applications.
Logging monitors what the application is doing, but equally importantly, it logs what the application is not doing. 
Looking into application logs can help you take an application out of a faulty state, or even help prevent it from happening.

## Setting logging levels dynamically

There are many frameworks used for logging in Java applications, for example [`Logback`](http://logback.qos.ch/), [`tinylog`](https://tinylog.org/v2/), or [`log4j2`](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html).
Kafka uses `log4j`, but we decided to use the newer `log4j2` for Strimzi operators.
The main reason is that `log4j2` uses the similar principles and format of a configuration file.
Strimzi components are split into the two groups regarding which implementation of `log4j` they use.

`log4j`
- Kafka brokers
- Kafka Connect
- Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0

`log4j2`
- Strimzi Kafka Bridge
- Strimzi Topic Operator
- Strimzi User Operator
- Strimzi Cluster Operator

A `Log4j2` implementation supports dynamic reloading of logging configuration from a properties file.
`Log4j` doesn't support reloading the whole log configuration from a properties file, but it can be changed programmatically using the `Log4j` APIs.
And that is why each implementation requires a different approach, which we will look at now.

### Strimzi Cluster Operator

In order to change the Cluster Operator logging config, a simple change is required.
You have to configure the logging settings in the `ConfigMap` used for Cluster Operator configuration.
This `ConfigMap` is by default called `strimzi-cluster-operator`.
To edit the logging configuration use:
```
$ kubectl edit cm strimzi-cluster-operator
```

Under the field `log4j2.properties` you will see the current logging configuration.
Now you can edit this configuration to whatever you want with one exception.
The entry `monitorInterval` must stay in place.
When it is removed, the configuration will not be reloaded dynamically.
To apply changes in such a case, a rolling update needs to be performed on the pod. 

The second way to change `ConfigMap` is to modify the file `install/cluster-operator/050-ConfigMap-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml`, and apply the changes by this command:

```
$ kubectl apply -f install/cluster-operator/050-ConfigMap-strimzi-cluster-operator.yaml
```

The same restrictions apply.
The entry `monitorInterval` must stay in place.

The change in logging takes some time to be applied. 
You can find out more in the **Implementation details** section of this post.

### Topic Operator, User Operator and Kafka resources

The approach to changing the logging configuration of User Operator, Topic Operator, Kafka Bridge, Kafka brokers, Kafka Connect and Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 did not change.
The logging is still configurable through the `inline` or `external` logging section of a custom resource specification.

Example of `inline` logging.
```yaml
...
logging:
  type: inline
  loggers:
    kafka.root.logger.level = INFO
...
```

Example of external logging.
```yaml
...
logging:
  type: external
  name: my-external-config-map
...
```

Only loggers can be changed dynamically.
Logging appenders are changed using an external `ConfigMap`, which triggers a rolling update.

This does not apply for Kafka Bridge, User operator, Topic operator and Cluster operator.
Because these use `log4j2` framework, even logging appenders are changeable dynmaicaly.


## Verifying logging levels are set correctly

In most cases, it takes a few seconds to change the logging level, and then you can observe the change in the logs.
If you want to check the loggers and logging levels are changed, you can use these commands.

For Kafka brokers:

```
$ kubectl  exec <kafka-cluster-name>-kafka-0 -- bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server <kafka-cluster-name>-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --entity-type broker-loggers --entity-name 0 --describe
```

You may wonder what value you should pass to `--entity-name`?
It should be the name of the Kafka broker that can be found in the broker configuration as the `broker.id` property.
In Strimzi, a broker has a name related to the name of pod where is it running.
So <kafka-cluster-name>-kafka-0 should have name '0', <kafka-cluster-name>-kafka-1 will be '1', etc.


For Kafka Connect, you can get loggers information by accessing Connect API service:

```
$ kubectl exec -ti <kafka-connect-pod-name> -- curl http://localhost:8083/admin/loggers
```

Since Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 is based on the Kafka Connect, getting its loggers is very similar:
```
$ kubectl exec -ti <kafka-mirror-maker-2-pod-name> -- curl http://localhost:8083/admin/loggers
```

Strimzi Cluster Operator, Topic Operator, Entity Operator and Strimzi Kafka Bridge use automatic reloading of logging configuration.
The only way to check the logging configuration of these components is by looking into the pod for the file on the path `/opt/strimzi/custom-config/log4j2.properties`.
It should contain the configuration and the `monitorInterval` property.
Note that reconciliation time, [re-mouting ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/#mounted-configmaps-are-updated-automatically) and `monitorInterval` value affect the time it takes for logging configuration to be reloaded.


## Implementation details

To implement dynamically changeable logging levels in Strimzi Cluster Operator, Topic Operator, Entity Operator and Strimzi Kafka Bridge we use the`log4j2` [automatic reconfiguration](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/log4j-2.1/manual/configuration.html#AutomaticReconfiguration) feature.

Automatic reloading works in these steps:
1. Logging configuration is changed in the custom resource
2. During reconciliation, the `log4j2.properties`  file containing the configuration from the custom resource is remounted. 
3. `log4j2` polls changes in the `log4j2.properties` file in an interval of `monitorInterval` seconds

For Kafka broker, Kafka Connect and Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0, we use features already implemented from Kafka.
Logging configuration in Kafka Brokers is changed using `AdminClient`.
For more information, see [KIP-412](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-412%3A+Extend+Admin+API+to+support+dynamic+application+log+levels)

Kafka Connect and Kafka MirrorMaker 2.0 logging configuration is changed using the REST API.
For more information, see [KIP-495](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-495%3A+Dynamically+Adjust+Log+Levels+in+Connect)

## Further steps

For now, there is no way to set logging configuration for Kafka MirrorMaker.
[KIP-649](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-649%3A+Dynamic+Client+Configuration) for dynamic client configuration is in progress.
However, Kafka MirrorMaker support will eventually be dropped, as it has been replaced by MirrorMaker 2.0.

The inability to set logging configuration dynamically applies to ZooKeeper as well.
[KIP-500](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-500%3A+Replace+ZooKeeper+with+a+Self-Managed+Metadata+Quorum) to replace ZooKeeper with a self-managed metadata quorum is planned, so we do not consider it as priority to implement this feature for the ZooKeeper cluster.

[KIP-653](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-653%3A+Upgrade+log4j+to+log4j2) to upgrade log4j to log4j2 has been proposed.
It should make the changes in logging even simpler on the Kafka side.

## Conclusion

Whether Strimzi is running in development or production environments, it is useful to be able to set an appropriate logging level.
Sometimes a Kafka cluster or operator is driven into an edge case.
With a less informative logging level it can be difficult to investigate what happened and how this situation can be fixed.
Also, changing the logging level causes a rolling update of the pod, which can put the cluster in a regular state and complicate the debugging of such an event.
Furthermore, any reason to roll Kafka pods lowers the availability of a Kafka cluster.
Applying logging configuration dynamically helps to resolve these issues.
And that is the main reason why we decided to implement dynamic logging levels in Strimzi 0.20.0 by using methods described in this post.
