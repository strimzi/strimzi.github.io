This week, most of the Cloud Native and Kubernetes world meets in San Diego for the [KubeCon+CloudNativeCon conference](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/) organized by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). 
As a CNCF Sandbox project, Strimzi will, of course, be represented there as well.
Read more to learn how to meet Strimzi maintainers and see Strimzi demos.

If you are attending KubeCon, you have two opportunities to see a live demo of Strimzi in the mini-theatre at the [Red Hat booth (#D1)](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/venue-map/):
* On **Tuesday at 3:50pm**
* On **Thursday at 11:10am**

_(The full demo schedule is available [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/events/red-hat-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019#demo-schedule))._

After the demo, we will be available for any questions or discussions related to Strimzi and Apache Kafka.

Of course, we know that KubeCon will be full of interesting talks.
So if you cannot make it to any of the demos because of some other talk, don't worry.
Jakub Scholz - one of our maintainers - will be available through the whole conference.
So if you want to meet and talk about Strimzi or Apache Kafka, just ping him on the #strimzi channel on [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) or at Twitter ([@strimziio](https://twitter.com/strimziio) or [@scholzj](https://twitter.com/scholzj)).
