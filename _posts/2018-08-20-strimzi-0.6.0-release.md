# Topic Operator moving to Custom Resources

With the previous 0.5.0 release, the Cluster Operator already moved from ConfigMaps to Custom Resources; now it is the time for the Topic Operator doing the same!
It means that Kafka topics aren't described by ConfigMaps anymore but through Custom Resources.
Here's an example snippet of the `KafkaTopic` resource for creating a Kafka topic in a deployed cluster:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: my-topic
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  partitions: 1
  replicas: 1
  config:
    retention.ms: 7200000
    segment.bytes: 1073741824
```

A Kafka topic is now a first-class citizen in the Kubernetes/OpenShift world and it can be managed through the `kubectl` and `oc` tools natively.
For example, you can get Kafka topic information through the following command:

```
oc describe kafkatopic my-topic
```

So `kafkatopic` is now at the same level as any other Kubernetes/OpenShift native resources, for example `configmap`, `deployment`, `secret` and `kafka` of course, as provided by the Cluster Operator, and so on.

# Kafka brokers listeners: let's make them configurable!

An Apache Kafka broker can have one or more listeners for accepting incoming connections from clients (consumer/producer) or other brokers as well (for replication). With this release, it is now possible to configure the `listeners` which will be enabled in the Kafka brokers.
The types of listeners currently supported are:

* PLAIN listener on port 9092 (without encryption)
* TLS listener on port 9093 (with encryption)

Here's an example snippet of a `Kafka` resource with both the listeners enabled:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    ...
    listeners:
      plain: {}
      tls: {}
    ...
```

Of course, it's possible to disable one of the listeners just not declaring it in the `Kafka` resource under the `listeners` field.
It's clear that when both the `plain` and `tls` sub-properties are not defined, the listeners will be disabled.

The listeners sub-properties might also contain additional configuration.
Currently, the only supported configuration is authentication on the `tls` listener, as described in the next section.

# Authentication and Authorization support

In order to have a more secure Kafka cluster, authentication and authorization play an important role.
For example, a client could be authenticated in order to have access to the cluster for sending/receiving messages and has to be authorized in order to do so for specific topics.
In most of the real scenarios, it's better than having "anonymous" access and the freedom to use all the available topics.

The authentication is configured as part of the `listener` configuration.
For each `listener`, it is possible to specify an `authentication` property with the type of authentication and related possible parameters.
When the `authentication` property is missing, no authentication will be enabled on given listener.

Currently, the only supported authentication mechanism is the TLS client authentication as declared in the following example snippet:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    ...
    listeners:
      tls:
        authentication:
          type: tls
    ...
```

The authorization is always configured for the whole Kafka cluster.
It means that when the authorization is enabled, through the corresponding `authorization` property, it will be applied for all enabled listeners.
When the `authorization` property is missing, no authorization will be enabled.

Currently, the only supported authorization method is the Simple authorization which uses the `SimpleAclAuthorizer` plugin that is the default authorization plugin which is part of the Apache Kafka project.

Here's an example snippet of a `Kafka` resource with authorization enabled:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    ...
    authorization:
      type: simple
    ...
```

# Managing users and their ACL permission with the new User Operator

With the addition of authentication and authorization, a simple way of declaring users was needed: here is the new User Operator!

The User Operator provides a way of managing Kafka users via Kubernetes/OpenShift resources.

It allows you to create a new user by declaring a `KafkaUser` resource.
When the user is created, the credentials will be created in a Secret.
Your application needs to use the user and its credentials for authentication and to produce or consume messages.

In addition to managing credentials for authentication, the User Operator also manages authorization rules by including a description of the userâ€™s permissions in the `KafkaUser` declaration: actually, it allows to handle the Apache Kafka ACLs (Access Control Lists).

Of course, with updating and deleting a `KafkaUser` resource you are able to update and delete the related user and permissions.

Here's an example snippet of a `KafkaUser` resource for describing a user:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaUser
metadata:
  name: my-user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
spec:
  authentication:
    type: tls
  authorization:
    type: simple
    acls:
      - resource:
          type: topic
          name: my-topic
          patternType: literal
        operation: Read
      - resource:
          type: topic
          name: my-topic-2
          patternType: literal
        operation: Write
```

The `authentication` property allows specifying the type of authentication which will be used for the user and, currently, the only supported authentication mechanism is the TLS Client Authentication mechanism.

When the `KafkaUser` is detected by the User Operator, it will create a new secret with the same name as the `KafkaUser` resource.
The secret will contain a public and private key which should be used for the TLS Client Authentication.
Bundled with them will be the public key of the client certification authority which was used to sign the user certificate.
All keys will be in X509 format.

Here's an example snippet of the secret containing the certificate and key:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/kind: KafkaUser
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
type: Opaque
data:
  ca.crt: # Public key of the Clients CA
  user.crt: # Public key of the user
  user.key: # Private key of the user
```

The `authorization` property allows specifying the type of authorization used for that user.
Currently, the only supported authorization type is the Simple authorization which means using the `SimpleAclAuthorizer` as the default authorization plugin which is part of the Apache Kafka project.

This kind of authorization is based on describing ACL rules in the `acls` property and for each of them, it's possible to define:

* `type`: type of ACL rule. Possible values are `allow` or `deny`.
* `operation`: specifies the operation which will be allowed or denied. Possible values are `Read`, `Write` and more.
* `resource`: specifies the resource for which does the rule apply. Possible values are `Topics`, `Consumer Groups` and `Clusters`.

Back to the above example snippet, we are describing a user `my-user` which is authenticated using TLS client authentication and it has the following permissions:

* it can `Read` from the topic `my-topic`
* it can `Write` to the topic `my-topic-2`

As you can see, thanks to the User Operator it's really simple handling Apache Kafka users and related permissions as native Kubernetes/OpenShift resources.

# Kafka Connect: new encryption and TLS client authentication support

The previous 0.5.0 release added TLS support for encrypting communication between all the main components in an Apache Kafka cluster, so between brokers, between Zookeeper nodes and between brokers and nodes themselves.
It also added encryption between the Topic Operator and the Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes.

The new release completes this feature adding the TLS support for encrypting communication between Kafka Connect worker nodes and the Kafka cluster.

The TLS support is configured in the `tls` property in the `KafkaConnect` resource and it contains a list of secrets with key names under which the certificates are stored.
They will be loaded in a related trust store in the Kafka Connect instance.
The certificates should be stored in X509 format.

Here's an example snippet of a `KafkaConnect` resource for configuring TLS:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  ...
  tls:
    trustedCertificates:
      - secretName: my-secret
        certificate: ca.crt
      - secretName: my-other-secret
        certificate: certificate.crt
  ...
```

Other than encryption, it's also possible to enable authentication through the `authentication` property.
Currently, the only supported authentication type is TLS client authentication.

TLS client authentication is using TLS certificate to authenticate.
The certificate has to be specified in the `certificateAndKey` property.
It is always loaded from an Kubernetes/OpenShift secret.
Inside the secret, it has to be stored in the X509 format under two different keys: for public and private keys.

Of course, the TLS client authentication works only if the TLS encryption is enabled as described before.

Here's an example snippet of a `KafkaConnect` resource for configuring TLS client authentication:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaConnect
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  ...
  authentication:
    type: tls
    certificateAndKey:
      secretName: my-secret
      certificate: public.crt
      key: private.key
  ...
```

The interesting thing is that the Kafka Connect cluster can be configured to connect using TLS and/or authentication to a Kafka cluster which doesn't need to be deployed by the Cluster Operator.

# The Entity Operator

Due to the addition of the new User Operator for handling Apache Kafka users and related permissions (ACLs) and already having the Topic Operator in place, we decided to simplify their deploying adding a new Entity Operator.

The Entity Operator is responsible for managing different entities in a running Kafka cluster that today are topics and users of course.
Both Topic and User Operators can be deployed on their own.
But the easiest way to deploy them is together with the Kafka cluster as part of the Entity Operator using the `topicOperator` and `userOperator` sub-properties under the main `entityOperator`.
The Entity Operator can include either one or both of them depending on the configuration.
They will be automatically configured to manage the topics and users of the Kafka cluster with which they are deployed.

Here's an example snippet of a `Kafka` resource with Entity Operator configured for deploying Topic and User Operators with default configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1alpha1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    ...
  zookeeper:
    ...
  entityOperator:
    topicOperator: {}
    userOperator: {}
```

The Entity Operator is also in charge to deploy the needed TLS sidecar for allowing encrypted communication between operators and the Zookeeper ensemble.

# Upgrade to latest Apache Kafka 2.0.0 release

At the beginning of August, the new Apache Kafka 2.0.0 version was released.
As always, the community worked hard to bring new features and bug fixes.
You can find more information about this release in the official [release notes](https://www.apache.org/dist/kafka/2.0.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html).

The new Strimzi release has now updated all the Docker images to use the new Apache Kafka 2.0.0 release.

# Helm charts for the Cluster Operator!

Strimzi community is growing and this time we had a really great contribution from [Sean Glover](https://twitter.com/seg1o) (Lightbend) for adding Helm Charts support!

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes which provides a simple way for deploying applications on Kubernetes through so called "charts".
Thanks to its templating model, it's possible to configure different parameters for the application before deploying it.

Today, we have Helm Charts for the Cluster Operator for simplifying its deployment on Kubernetes and configuring all the parameters related to the Apache Kafka deployment.

# Conclusion

This release represents another really huge milestone for this open source project.
Furthermore, because Strimzi is an evolving project, there are some deprecations as well; for more information about them, you can refer to the release [changes log](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi/releases/tag/0.5.0).
