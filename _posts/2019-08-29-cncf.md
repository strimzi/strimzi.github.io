We are excited to announce that Strimzi is joining the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a [Sandbox Project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/).
The CNCF oversees many projects that provide critical infrastructure in cloud based environments and we are thrilled to be part of that community.
From the core Kubernetes project to exciting early stage projects such as CloudEvents we feel Strimzi is in esteemed company.

Strimzi provides Operators to deploy and manage the components of [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) on Kubernetes.
This includes the Kafka brokers, Apache ZooKeeper, MirrorMaker and Kafka Connect.
Having Kubernetes-native APIs makes it easy to manage Kafka topics and users, and there are [multiple ways](https://strimzi.io/2019/04/17/accessing-kafka-part-1.html) to enable secure access to Kafka from outside the Kubernetes cluster.
Recent additions to the project have included an [HTTP bridge](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-bridge) to enable additional protocol support; improved support for [scaling the persistent storage](https://strimzi.io/2019/07/08/persistent-storage-improvements.html) used by the Kafka brokers and monitoring using Prometheus.

Since its inception in 2017 Strmizi has become a production ready mechanism for running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes.
Initially begun by three developers, the project now has significantly more than that contributing to making it a success from organisations such as Red Hat, Lightbend and others.
It is used in production in industries including telecoms, finance and transportation.
Strimzi is used in Knative Eventing as the default Kafka provider and forms the base of other data streaming platforms offering event driven integrations.
We hope that membership of the CNCF will allow many more users to adopt Apache Kafka on Kubernetes for their applications.

The Strimzi community is friendly and driven by the desire to further Open Source principles - we are always open to new contributions.
Please do get involved, not just through code; documentation improvements, bug reports and blog posts are all appreciated.
You can download the latest version of Strimzi [here](https://strimzi.io/downloads/) and say hello on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/strimzi/shared_invite/enQtMzU2Mjk3NTgxMzE5LTYyMTUwMGNlMDQwMzBhOGI4YmY4MjhiMDgyNjA5OTk2MTFiYjc4M2Q3NGU1YTFjOWRiMzM2NGMwNDUwMjBlNDY).

We are excited to be part of the CNCF and are looking forward to the next chapter.
We hope you will join us on that journey!
