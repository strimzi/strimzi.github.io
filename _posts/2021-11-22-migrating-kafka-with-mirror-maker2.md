In this article we would like to focus on the most common challenges to migrate Apache
Kafka clusters between different OpenShift platforms, and how to overcome
them by using Apache MirrorMaker and [Strimzi Operators](https://strimzi.io/).

*NOTE*: The article and the examples describe and implement the process for OpenShift, the
enterprise version of Kubernetes from Red Hat. However the content applies perfectly for
a Kubernetes platform.

Nowadays, many modern architectures are deployed on top of container management platforms.
OpenShift is one of the most standard of those platforms. These modern
architectures are based in many patterns
([Event-Driven Architectures](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture),
[Capture Data Change](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-change-data-capture),
[Reactive Systems](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/))
using data streaming platforms as backbone to glue everything in a fashion way. Apache Kafka is the most extended
component to implement that backbone. 

OpenShift and Apache Kafka are evolving so fast, and organizations are
evolving their Cloud platforms where they face some of the following migration
use cases: 

* Upgrading the Cloud platform to latest versions
* Migrating on-prem cloud platforms to public or hybrid cloud platforms

## Migration Scenario

The most typical migration scenario includes an existing OpenShift
platform where there is already an Apache Kafka cluster running successfully
and a set of producer and consumer applications. The Apache Kafka cluster
then must be moved to a new target OpenShift platform (this decision could
be driven by different topics that are out of scope of this article), but
the migration must cover the following requirements:

* No data loss between clusters, so both must be synchronized.
* Transition period to migrate applications step-by-step and avoid
a *Big Bang* migration.
* *Optionally* upgrading the Apache Kafka cluster to newest versions.

The first two requirements are the most important and common in any
migration project, because it is very complex to coordinate all the actors
at the same time. The migration process must be robust to avoid any data
loss but at the same time should be smooth and easy to allow migrations
of the workloads when they are ready to go. However the latest requirement is
aligned with a modernization that is usually done before or after the
migration. Introducing new changes during the migration could add
complexity to the process and impact troubleshooting when something was
wrong. We will cover the upgrade process only to describe some capabilities
of the migration but it is something that you should consider when you
migrate your Apache Kafka clusters.

This solution requires an Active-Passive topology of the Apache Kafka
clusters. The active Apache Kafka cluster is the current online deployed
in the source OpenShift platform, and the passive Apache Kafka cluster is
the new one deployed in the target OpenShift platform. However, at the end
of the migration the passive Apache Kafka cluster became active as soon
as the latest application was connected to it. At that moment we could
stop and remove the original one.

## Migration Process Overview

This migration process follow the Consumer First approach (it means
basically start moving the consumers before the producers) and it could
be summarized as:

1. Exposing externally the source Apache Kafka cluster to external
clients of OpenShift, if it is not already exposed. More info
[here](https://strimzi.io/blog/2019/04/17/accessing-kafka-part-1/).
2. Define an user to migrate data from the source Apache Kafka cluster. This
user must have the right grants to consume data from topics and create
topics. It could be a good recommendation to define as a super-user. More
info [here](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/using.html#super_users).
    * Get or extract certificates and migration user credentials,
    they are needed later.
3. Deploy new Apache Kafka cluster in target OpenShift platform. This
new cluster should have the same topology as the original
one (# brokers, resources, …) to have an 1-1 scenario.
    * *Optionally* we could deploy a higher version of Kafka. Applications
    migrated **must** be aligned to the Kafka API declared, otherwise
    Apache Kafka brokers will have to perform down-conversion
    continuously (not desirable as it will impact in the performance)
4. Deploy MirrorMaker in the target OpenShift platform.
5. Verify topics and data are created in the target Apache Kafka cluster.
6. Move consumers from the source Apache Kafka cluster to the target
Apache Kafka cluster. (Remember Consumer First approach)
7. Verify data consumption is working successfully.
8. Move producers from the source Apache Kafka cluster to the target
Apache Kafka cluster.
9. Verify data production is working successfully.

The migration process could add many different required or optional
tasks aligned with the details or specific activities, but in general
the process will be very similar to this one.

Now, let’s see how we could execute it.

## MirrorMaker, the migration tool

The Apache Kafka ecosystem provides a tool to replicate data between
different Apache Kafka clusters: [Apache MirrorMaker](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#georeplication).

**NOTE**: There are other approaches to migrate Apache Kafka workloads
based on other tools and processes, but all of them are out of the
scope. We think that the Apache Kafka ecosystem provides the right tools
to help in this scenario.

This tool helps to define data flows that cross the boundaries of an
Apache Kafka cluster to extend to others, allowing to cover different uses
cases and scenarios such as:

* Geo-replication
* Disaster recovery
* Feeding edge cluster into a central, aggregate cluster
* Cloud migration or hybrid cloud deployments (we are here)
* Legal, technical, or compliance requirements

MirrorMaker provides currently two different implementations:

* **MirrorMaker 1**: The first implementation with basic functionality
to consume and produce data from the source to the target. It is very
limited and it could help you to replicate only data payloads. 
* **MirrorMaker 2**: Improved implementation based on
[KafkaConnect framework](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect)
allowing  replication of more things (topics and its configuration,
consumer groups offsets, ACLs), and more features (detects new topics/partitions,
metrics, fault-tolerant and HA).

This article is based on MirrorMaker2 because it will include a set of
features needed to cover our requirements. The most important features are:

* **Topic topology replication**, as we need to have the same structure of
the topic and partitions in the target Kafka cluster.
* **Consumer group offset synchronization**, as we need to consume the data
from the target Kafka cluster at the same point the consumers stopped in
the source Kafka cluster. This feature tries to avoid consuming duplicated
messages in the target cluster.
* **Dynamic detection of configuration changes** in source Kafka cluster and replicate in
target Kafka cluster. Every change must be replicated in the target Kafka cluster.
* **Replication ACL** rules that manage access to source brokers and topics
apply to target topics. If we are not using the [User Operator of
Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/using.html#assembly-using-the-user-operator-str),
in that case we should recreate the KafkaUsers in the target cluster.
More info [here](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/using.html#con-mirrormaker-acls-str).

The synchronization processes are managed by a [set of properties](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#georeplication-flow-configure)
to set up intervals and checkpoints. It is important to review and
check these properties and the applications movements to avoid or reduce
the duplication process of some data.

MirrorMaker2 [could rename the topics](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#georeplication-topic-naming)
in the target Kafka cluster (remote topics) with some patterns
and conventions. During a migration process this kind of changes are
not a good idea, it is a best practice to maintain a 1-1 relationship
between the source and kafka cluster. 

### MirrorMaker2 Connectors

MirrorMaker2 deploys a KafkaConnect cluster with a set of different
Kafka Connectors to execute the migration and synchronization between clusters.

* **MirrorSourceConnector** is responsible for topics, data replication based
on a replication policy, and other synchronization tasks such as ACL
rules, renaming topics, …
* **MirrorCheckpointConnector** is responsible for track offset for
consumer groups and synchronizing into the target Kafka cluster.
* **MirrorHeartbeatConnector** is responsible for checking the connectivity
between clusters using a set of heartbeats and checks.

The action combinated of all of them, using a set of internal topics,
executes this complex process of migrating and synchronizing both
Kafka clusters.

## Strimzi Operators make migrations happier

Operating an Apache Kafka system with all these components in an
OpenShift environment sounds like a huge and complex activity, however
the reality is that is very easy thanks to the powerful
[Kubernetes Operators](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
provided by the great community of [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io/).

Strimzi provides a full list of operators to help streamline
the installation, configuration, and maintenance operations for OpenShift
platforms. Thanks to these operators we could manage this complex migration
scenario with a small few resources to achieve our goals.

More information and details about these operators, review the
[Quick Start Guide](https://strimzi.io/docs/operators/latest/quickstart.html).

## Migration Deployment Topology

We could draw our migration process and topology as:

![Migration Deployment Topology](/assets/images/posts/2021-11-22-kafka-migration-topology.png)

Easy, right?

## Show me the code

Before to move to the code, and the technical details,
keep in mind the following points:

* The Apache Kafka ecosystem provides great tools
to migrate data, but they are not enough.
* It is important to have a holistic plan to coordinate
all the actors: producers, consumers, brokers, security, …
* The plan must include a rollback path, and backups
before to start (the things could go wrong ...)
* Follow the plan, check and test every step. Coordination
is key to success.
* Don't include changes in your topology, if you
could do it ... adding new things during a migration
could be a nightmare for debugging or testing.

Sounds good, right? But, Does it work? Could you show me the code?

Of course, we developed this use case in a GitHub
repository, with a set of instructions, commands and
manifests for your testing and verification. The repo
demonstrates how the different components could work
together and resolve the main requirements of the use
case. You could find it here:

[https://github.com/rmarting/strimzi-migration-demo](https://github.com/rmarting/strimzi-migration-demo)

We are open to get feedback, comments and improvements
of this use case.
