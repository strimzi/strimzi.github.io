We are very pleased to announce the return of StrimziCon, scheduled later this year!
After the huge success of [StrimziCon 2024](https://strimzi.io/blog/2024/06/06/strimzicon2024-roundup/), the Strimzi community decided to repeat the event for 2025.
Like last year, this is going to be focused on our beloved Strimzi and Apache Kafka projects and it will be "virtual".
It is organized and driven by the project maintainers in collaboration with the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

### Why attend StrimziCon?

StrimziCon is an event for developers, DevOps engineers, and solution architects who want to learn about Strimzi and event streaming.
This event will bring together the Strimzi community, and you will learn from experts and users about use cases, best practices, and their experience using Strimzi in their organizations.
If you are working with cloud-native technologies, and you are looking for how to deal with data in motion in a cloud-based environment, donâ€™t miss the opportunity.

The conference will take place on <b>Wednesday, June 4th</b> (afternoon CEST).

The call for <b>speakers</b> is now open, and we're eagerly awaiting your proposals to discuss:

* <b>Core Strimzi</b>: Deep dive into a specific component or feature.
* <b>Case Studies</b>: Provide an overview of a use case or review of a real life Strimzi deployment, highlighting difficulties, lessons learned, and key takeaways.
* <b>Integrations</b>: Explore how Strimzi integrates with other CNCF projects, such as OpenTelemetry, KEDA and more.
* <b>Operations</b>: Share insights into what it takes to run Strimzi and maintain clusters in production.

The submission deadline is March 16th.

### From the community to the community

We encourage any community members to submit a talk: from a Strimzi deep dive, to how you operate and use it in production, through integrations with other projects.
From the community to the community, this is the best way to share.

Paolo Patierno and Kate Stanley, as maintainers and contributors in the Strimzi community, have been organizing the conference together with the CNCF team, and will be your host during the event.

All the submitted sessions will be evaluated by the StrimziCon program committee made up of people from different companies which already use Strimzi in production as adopters.
