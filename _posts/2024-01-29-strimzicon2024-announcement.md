We are very pleased to announce the first StrimziCon coming this year!
This is going to be the first conference focused on our beloved Strimzi and Apache Kafka projects and it will be "virtual".
It is organized and driven by the project maintainers in collaboration with the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

StrimziCon is an event for developers, DevOps engineers, and solution architects who want to learn about Strimzi and event streaming.
This event will bring together the Strimzi community, and you will learn from experts and users about use cases, best practices, and their experience using Strimzi in their organizations.
If you are working with cloud-native technologies, and you are looking for how to deal with data in motion in a cloud-based environment, don’t miss the opportunity.

It will take place on **Wednesday, May 22nd** (afternoon CEST) and will feature two parallel tracks on the following themes:

* Features, How Strimzi Works.
* Operations, Using Strimzi with other projects.

The Call for Speakers is open and it's waiting for you to send your proposals to talk about:

* **Core Strimzi**: Deep dive into a specific component or feature.
* **Case Studies**: Overview of a use case or review of a real life Strimzi deployment, difficulties, gotcha, main takeaways.
* **Integrations**: How Strimzi can be used together with other CNCF projects (i.e. OpenTelemetry, KEDA, …).
* **Operations**: What it takes to run Strimzi and maintain cluster in production.

It will close on March 10th.

All the submitted sessions will be evaluated by the StrimziCon committee made up of people from different companies which already use Strimzi in production as adopters.
We'll have representative from (in alphabetical order) Apple, Atruvia, Axual, Decathlon, IBM, Red Hat, and SBB.
The committee members will leverage their experience and knowledge on the project as users and contributors in order to select the best proposals and make an awesome agenda.
