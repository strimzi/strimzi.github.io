Finally, it is October and it is time for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!
As stated on the official website, "Hacktoberfest is a month long celebration of open source software" and it is open to everyone contributing to open source projects.
So ... why not contribute to Strimzi and get some swag as well?

Run by DigitalOcean, 2020 is the 7th edition of this event encouraging people all around the world to contribute to open source projects.
Whether you are a developer, student, techical writer or a company, you can help communities to improve the projects they develop and host on GitHub.
It's done as a challenge: you have to contribute at least four pull requests between October 1st and October 31st in order to get a limited edition T-shirt or plant a tree.
You can find more information about the rules and the onboarding process on the official [website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

Maybe you are asking to yourself, "why are they talking about Hacktoberfest on the Strimzi website?"
It is simple! Right?

The Strimzi community would be really happy to take part at this event and have more people contributing.
After the last blog post, about the [Strimzi survey results](https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/09/29/strimzi-survey-results/), we noticed that developers would love to contribute to Strimzi and they planned to do so.
So, what is stopping you?
What could be a better opportunity than starting with the Hacktoberfest?

From simple to more complex ones, from code to documentation, you can find different [issues](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues) on our GitHub repository to begin your journey.

We already have some issues labeled as [good-start](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/labels/good-start) and [help wanted](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/labels/help%20wanted) mostly about coding; if you feel you could help improving the documentation, there are [issues](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/labels/documentation) for that as well.
Also, please don't be scared about opening new issues and working on them!

If you don't find something that can fit your knowledge or you have any kind of problems or need advice, don't hesitate to ask us anything on [Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) or the [mailing list](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-strimzi-users/topics).

What are you waiting for? October has already started... and so has Hacktoberfest!
