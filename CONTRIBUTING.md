# Contributing

You can contribute by:

* Raising any issues you find using Strimzi
* Fixing issues by opening Pull Requests
* Improving documentation
* Talking about Strimzi

All bugs, tasks or enhancements are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues). 
Issues which might be a good start for new contributors are marked with the ["good-start"](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/labels/good-start) label.

The [Hacking guide](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/blob/master/HACKING.md) describes how to build Strimzi and how to test your changes before submitting a patch or opening a PR.

The [Documentation Contributor Guide](https://strimzi.io/contributing/guide/) describes how to contribute to Strimzi documentation.
